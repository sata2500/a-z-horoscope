## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the project locally. It is designed to be as straightforward as possible, but please open an issue if you encounter any problems.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v22.x or higher
- **npm:** v10.x or higher
- **Git:** Version control
- **PostgreSQL:** A running instance (local or remote)
- **Google Cloud Project:** Required for Google OAuth and Gemini API.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sata2500/a-z-horoscope.git
cd a-z-horoscope
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses `npm` for package management. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

*Note: During installation, you might encounter errors related to `node-gyp` or C++ build tools. This is often because some dependencies require native compilation. Ensure you have a proper build environment set up.*

**On Windows:**
```bash
npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

**On macOS:**
Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, fill in the required values in your new `.env` file:

```env
# Database URL (e.g., from Neon or local PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"

# Google Gemini API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."

# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."

# NextAuth Secret
# Generate one: `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_SECRET="..."

# Application URL
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email Service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="..."
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

This command will sync your database schema with the Prisma schema and generate the Prisma Client.

```bash
npm run prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

Now you are ready to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.

## 🧪 Running Tests

(Coming Soon) This project will use Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Once configured, you will be able to run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
